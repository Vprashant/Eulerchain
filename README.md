## Introduction 🌟

Eulerchain is a versatile framework designed to facilitate the creation of sophisticated RPA flows and RAG processes. By utilizing graph-based RAG, Eulerchain offers an efficient and scalable solution for AI-driven automation.

## Installation 🛠️

To get started with Eulerchain, install it using pip:

```sh
pip install eulerchain
```

## Architecture 🏛️

Eulerchain's architecture is built around modular components, making it easy to extend and customize. The core components include:

- **Flow Manager**: Manages the creation and execution of RPA flows.
- **Task Scheduler**: Schedules and executes individual tasks within a flow.
- **RAG Engine**: Handles retrieval-augmented generation tasks.
- **Graph RAG Processor**: Manages graph-based RAG workflows.

## Core Concepts 💡

### Flows 🌊

A **Flow** represents a sequence of tasks to be executed in a specific order. Flows can be simple or complex, depending on the use case.

### Tasks 🛠️

A **Task** is an individual unit of work within a flow. Tasks can perform various actions, such as data retrieval, processing, or interaction with external systems.

### RAG 📚

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** combines retrieval and generation capabilities to enhance AI workflows. It retrieves relevant information and generates responses based on that information.

### Graph RAG 🌐

**Graph RAG** extends RAG by organizing information in a graph structure, allowing for more efficient retrieval and generation processes. This is particularly useful for complex workflows involving multiple data sources and relationships.

## Usage 📋

### Creating Flows

To create a new flow, use the `create_flow` method:

```python
from eulerchain import EulerChain

chain = EulerChain()
flow = chain.create_flow("MyFlow")
```

### Adding Tasks

Add tasks to the flow using the `add_task` method:

```python
flow.add_task("Task1", lambda: print("Executing Task 1"))
flow.add_task("Task2", lambda: print("Executing Task 2"))
```

### Executing Flows

Execute the flow using the `execute_flow` method:

```python
chain.execute_flow("MyFlow")
```

## Advanced Features 🔧

### Custom Components

You can create custom components to extend the functionality of Eulerchain. For example, creating a custom task:

```python
from eulerchain import Task

class CustomTask(Task):
    def execute(self):
        print("Executing custom task")

chain.create_flow("CustomFlow").add_task("CustomTask", CustomTask())
```

### Integration with APIs

Eulerchain supports seamless integration with various APIs. For example, integrating with a weather API:

```python
import requests

def fetch_weather():
    response = requests.get("https://api.weather.com/v3/wx/conditions/current")
    return response.json()

flow.add_task("FetchWeather", fetch_weather)
```

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage task failures gracefully:

```python
def safe_task():
    try:
        # Task logic here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Task failed: {e}")

flow.add_task("SafeTask", safe_task)
```

## Best Practices 🌟

- **Modularity**: Keep your tasks modular and reusable.
- **Documentation**: Document your flows and tasks for better maintainability.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your tasks and flows to ensure reliability.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to manage failures gracefully.
